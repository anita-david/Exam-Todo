## How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-alt.git
cd react-todo-alt

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## Architectural Decisions

TanStack Router was chosen for its modern nested routing capabilities and tight React integration.

TanStack Query simplifies data fetching and syncing with the server.

Tailwind speeds up responsive design and helps maintain consistency.

localStorage was used to persist user-created todos that don't exist on the mock API.

---

## Limitations

Handling update/delete logic for newly created todos not in the JSON API

---

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

# preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## Future Improvements

Replace JSONPlaceholder with a real backend

Add user authentication

Use IndexedDB for full offline support

Add unit/integration tests
